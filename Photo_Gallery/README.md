# Photo Gallery HTML Code

This README.md file provides an overview of the HTML code for creating a photo gallery. The code is designed to display a collection of images in a visually appealing way on a web page. Below are the steps used in creating the code and an explanation of the key elements used:

## Steps to Create the Photo Gallery

1. **HTML Structure**: The code starts with the basic HTML structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the opening `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. **Meta Tags**: The `<meta>` tags within the `<head>` section specify the character encoding and viewport settings for the web page.

3. **Title**: The `<title>` tag inside the `<head>` section sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's tab.

4. **CSS Link**: A `<link>` tag is used to link an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to apply custom styles to the photo gallery.

5. **Header**: The `<header>` element contains an `<h1>` heading with the title "css flexbox photo gallery." This serves as the title for the photo gallery.

6. **Image Gallery**: The `<div>` element with the class "gallery" is the container for the photo gallery. Inside this container, a series of `<img>` tags are used to display the images.

7. **Images**: Each `<img>` tag includes the `src` attribute with the URL of an image and the `alt` attribute with a brief description of the image for accessibility.

## Usage

To use this code and create your own photo gallery:

1. Copy the HTML code provided above and paste it into an HTML file (e.g., `photo_gallery.html`).

2. Create a separate CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to define the styles for the photo gallery's layout, image display, and any other customizations.

3. Link the CSS file in the `<head>` section of your HTML file using the `<link>` tag:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
   ```

   Replace `./styles.css` with the correct path to your CSS file.

4. Replace the `src` and `alt` attributes of the `<img>` tags with the URLs and alt text for your images. You can add more images by duplicating the `<img>` tags as needed.

5. Save both the HTML and CSS files.

6. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view your customized photo gallery.

## Notes

- This code provides a basic structure for creating a photo gallery. You can further customize the appearance and layout by editing the `styles.css` file to suit your design preferences.

- Ensure that your images are hosted on a server, and use the correct image URLs in the `src` attributes of the `<img>` tags.

- It's important to provide meaningful and descriptive `alt` text for each image to improve accessibility and SEO.

Feel free to adapt and expand upon this code to create a photo gallery that fits your specific needs and design requirements.

**Note:** Make sure you have the necessary rights and permissions for the images you use in your photo gallery, and consider optimizing them for web display to enhance performance.
