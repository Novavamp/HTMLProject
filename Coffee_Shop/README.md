# Cafe Menu HTML Code

This README.md file provides an overview of the HTML code for creating a cafe menu web page. The code is designed to display a cafe menu with coffee and dessert items. Below are the steps used in creating the code and an explanation of the key elements used:

## Steps to Create the Cafe Menu

1. **HTML Structure**: The code begins with the basic HTML structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. **Meta Tags**: The `<meta>` tags within the `<head>` section specify the character encoding and viewport settings for the web page.

3. **Title**: The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's tab.

4. **CSS Link**: A `<link>` tag is used to link an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to apply custom styles to the cafe menu.

5. **Header**: Inside the `<body>`, the main content of the cafe menu is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the class "menu." Within this container:
   
   - An `<h1>` heading serves as the cafe's name, "CAMPER CAFE."
   - A `<p>` element with the class "established" provides the establishment year, "Est. 2020."
   - A `<hr>` element creates a horizontal line separator.

6. **Menu Sections**: The menu items are grouped into two sections, "Coffee" and "Desserts." Each section is defined using a `<section>` element and includes:
   
   - An `<h2>` heading indicating the section name.
   - An `<img>` element displaying an icon representing the section (coffee or dessert).
   - Multiple `<article>` elements, each representing a menu item. Each `<article>` includes:
     
     - A `<p>` element with a class representing the item name (e.g., "flavor" or "dessert").
     - A `<p>` element with a class representing the item price.

7. **Bottom Line**: After the menu sections, another `<hr>` element with the class "bottom-line" creates a bottom separator.

8. **Footer**: A `<footer>` element at the bottom of the menu contains:
   
   - A `<p>` element with a link to the cafe's website.
   - A `<p>` element with the cafe's address.

## Usage

To use this code and display the cafe menu on a web page:

1. Copy the HTML code provided above and paste it into an HTML file (e.g., `cafe_menu.html`).

2. Create a separate CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to define the styles for the cafe menu, including layout, colors, typography, and any additional customizations.

3. Link the CSS file in the `<head>` section of your HTML file using the `<link>` tag:

   ```html
   <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

4. Customize the appearance of the cafe menu by modifying the styles in the `styles.css` file. You can change colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual properties to match your cafe's branding.

5. Save both the HTML and CSS files.

6. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view and interact with your customized cafe menu.

## Notes

- This code provides a basic structure for creating a cafe menu. You can further customize the appearance, add more menu items, or incorporate additional sections as needed for your cafe's offerings.

- The provided code includes placeholder images for coffee and dessert icons. You can replace these with actual images or icons that represent your cafe's menu items.

Feel free to adapt and expand upon this code to create a visually appealing and informative cafe menu for your website.
