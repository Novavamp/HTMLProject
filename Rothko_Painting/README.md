# Rothko Painting HTML Code

This README.md file provides an overview of the HTML code for displaying a Rothko-inspired painting on a web page. The code is designed to create an abstract visual representation using HTML and CSS. Below are the steps used in creating the code and an explanation of the key elements used:

## Steps to Create the Rothko Painting

1. **HTML Structure**: The code starts with the basic HTML structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. **Meta Tags**: The `<meta>` tag within the `<head>` section specifies the character encoding for the web page.

3. **Title**: The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's tab.

4. **CSS Link**: A `<link>` tag is used to link an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to apply custom styles to the painting.

5. **Painting Container**: The painting is contained within a `<div>` element with the class "frame." This acts as the frame or border around the painting.

6. **Canvas**: Within the frame, another `<div>` element with the class "canvas" represents the actual canvas or painting surface.

7. **Painting Blocks**: Inside the canvas, there are three `<div>` elements with classes "one," "two," and "three." These represent the abstract blocks of color that make up the Rothko-inspired painting.

## Usage

To use this code and create your own Rothko-inspired painting:

1. Copy the HTML code provided above and paste it into an HTML file (e.g., `rothko_painting.html`).

2. Create a separate CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to define the styles for the painting, including colors, positioning, and dimensions.

3. Link the CSS file in the `<head>` section of your HTML file using the `<link>` tag:

   ```html
   <link href="./styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

   Replace `./styles.css` with the correct path to your CSS file.

4. Customize the appearance of the painting by modifying the styles in the `styles.css` file. You can change the colors, dimensions, and positions of the abstract blocks to create your desired visual effect.

5. Save both the HTML and CSS files.

6. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view your customized Rothko-inspired painting.

## Notes

- This code provides a basic structure for creating an abstract painting using HTML and CSS. You can experiment with different colors, sizes, and arrangements to achieve your artistic vision.

- The provided code uses abstract div elements to represent the painting's blocks of color. You can adjust the number and arrangement of these blocks as needed.

- Consider adding interactivity or animation to enhance the visual experience of the painting.

Feel free to adapt and expand upon this code to create unique and visually engaging web-based artworks.
